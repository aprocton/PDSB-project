# Final Project - Code Review
Alexander M. Procton

Peers reviewed: Vijay Ramesh, Anika Petach, Nicholas Locatelli

__In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?__

Vijay's README is the most thorough, explaining the research problem and providing clear instructions for downloading his data and notebooks, as well as the directory structure. Anika's is very clear about how to download her scripts and she directs the reader to the notebook containing her demonstration. Nick is more terse but he also directs the reader to his demo notebook. I think my own README is also clear, especially about installing igraph (and cairo if necessary).

__Did your peers have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?__

All three of the peers I am reviewing have their code in Jupyter notebooks. Vijay's and Anika's code is clear, but Nick's code does not seem to be working as of now.

__Did your peers provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peers are trying to solve in the notebooks?__

Yes, and Anika's and Vijay's are clear and explain their project, while Nick's is broken at the moment.

__Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peers' project directories?__

Anika's project inspired me to consider networkx for my side project about rock climber social networks, but I decided to use igraph for this project because I disliked the networkx graphics interface.
